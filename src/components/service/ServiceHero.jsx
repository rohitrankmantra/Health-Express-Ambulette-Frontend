Are you looking for a service that can take your patients or family members safely and carefully to the doctor? You can try using our Ambulette services for this job. We are the Health Express Ambulette  All City  Transportation Ambulette Company, and we want to help people who need to get around.


Visits to the doctor: People who are older or have physical disabilities often don’t have family or friends who can help them, especially when they need to go to the doctor’s office. We have state-of-the-art vans with hydraulic lifts that make it easy for people in wheelchairs to get to clinics for doctor appointments.

Transportation to the clinic: Have you ever had to move a patient, family member, or friend to a different hospital for better care and facilities? It’s so hard to figure out how to get there without having to pay for another ambulance. They can’t take a private cab or taxi because they aren’t made for wheelchairs, and taking an ambulance isn’t an option because it’s only used in emergencies.

Cities we serve:

Brooklyn 
Staten Island
Queens
Manhattan
Bronx
Nassau County
